**I. ABOUT**

This is a demo database created using ReactJS. It serves as an interactive mockup of the internal dashboard to be created for GBLS to view client data. You can view the website [here](https://gbls-dashboard.onrender.com/) (may take some time to build)

This demo database pulls client information from a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mG9ChXcHKXjQCDXWVJccEG130tbclYFHBptU7ewrdFk/edit?usp=sharing) and displays graphs of quantities of various data. This data currently includes:

- Language  
- Cities of Origin  
- Client Info  
  - Veterans  
  - Disabled  
  - DV/Sexual Assault  
  - Sexual Orientation  
- Race and Gender

The data on the demo database can be modified by adding/removing/changing data in the spreadsheet. To edit the spreadsheet, please request edit access.

There is also a search feature to find clients whose name starts with the given first and last name prefixes at the top.
